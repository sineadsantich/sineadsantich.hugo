I am a Fourth year Cinema and Digital Media student, in the University Honors Program, 
at the University of California, Davis. I live in the Davis, and am an avid cyclist and dog enthusiast. I love flowers, eating food, and making videos.

So why study media and landscape restoration? Well, I have a strong interest in science communications. By combining my interest of media, plants and environmental restoration, I hope to educate people about what strides are happening in the field, and how they can help.
