My name is Sinead Santich, and I am a documentary filmmaker and visual storyteller. 

My films lie at intersection of society and the environment, sharing the stories of people who strive for a better future. I bring the essence of their stories to screen.

I have a degree in Cinema and Digital Media and a minor in Landscape Restoration from UC Davis. By combining my interests in media and science, I developed filmmaking skills that I use to transform scientific research into emotionally tangible stories. 

I continue to produce films which inspire and sow the seeds of positive change. I'm always interested in learning more and collaborating with others, so please feel free to reach out!
