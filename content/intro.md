Welcome!! My name is Sinead Santich, I'm a fourth year Cinema and Digital Media Major, and Landscape Restoration Minor at UC Davis. Check out some my [work](#work)!

Media has the power to educate, inspire, and change lives. I have worked on projects about Women's Health, Bike Advocacy, Feminism, Landscape Restoration, Affordable Housing, and Cultural Burning.
