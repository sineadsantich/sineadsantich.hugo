Welcome!! My name is Sinead Santich, I'm a fourth year Cinema and Digital Media Major, and Landscape Restoration Minor at UC Davis. Check out my [awesome work](#work).

I am graduating in June, and looking to get a job in media production. From science communication, to social documentaries, and I am excited to get to work on video projects that educate and inspire change.
